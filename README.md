# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

This week's challenge was to create a web API code quiz. 
I was able to achieve this using sytle sheets, html and a html start, and for the functionality for this quiz to work, used JS. This was tested on the browser which showed the correct answers and the wrong answers also another opporunity to redo quiz.

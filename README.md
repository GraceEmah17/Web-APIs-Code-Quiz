# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

This week's challenge was to create a web API code quiz. 
I was able to achieve this using sytle sheets, html and a html start. In order for the quiz to be successful, the functionality used for this quiz was JavaScript. This was tested on the browser which showed the correct answers and the wrong answers also another opporunity to redo quiz if not satisfied with result.
